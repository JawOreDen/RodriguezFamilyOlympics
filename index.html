                            <p id="font" class=""> Hello Family, this is your invitation for the Thirty-Second Annual Rodriguez Family Olympics. Some of I you will be out of the state or out of the country when you receive this invitation. Even though I have not seen you in a while treasure the memories that I have of you, you may not be able to make it so I wanted to send it to remind you that there is a place for you at the starting line no matter how far you are.

                              The purpose of the Family Olympics has always been to celebrate the death and ressurection of Jesus and secondly to encourage our family to stay physically fit. I have always believed that our God based principles are the foundation of our family. As we can all see we no longer spend time as a whole family the way we did in the past and that is not necessarily a negative thing it's just life. Our families have grown and the gatherings that we used to have on a regular basis are no longer feasible. The Family Olympics is an oportunity to stay connected with the family, wo knows, 20 years into the future we may have to be wearing name tags to know wo everyone is. But that is the beauty of it, not many people have the opportunity to grow together as a family. I hope that the young people in the family can see the benefit and put an effort to keep it going. And quoting the famous philosopher Forrest Gump "That's all I have to say about that."

                              This year we will be going back to Avocado Lake, back to the original spot we always used. There is not much shade on that site anymore so remember to bring your canopy. We will be awarding 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place ribbons for all of the events. As always prepare yourself to have a great day, bring enough food for your Family and a little extra.

                              <h3 id="bible">Philippians 4:12 I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.</h3>
